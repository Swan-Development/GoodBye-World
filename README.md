# GoodBye-World
Just another repository
I have knowledge of and experience in creating ASP.NET MVC Web Applications in Visual Studio, using Entity Framework with Code First migrations, using C# as the server-side language. I also have some experience in querying and editing records directly in a database using T-SQL.
Having recently passed my second MTA exam I feel I am ready to begin my career within It and Software Developtment. I have always had an innate passion to create, innovate and develop in all areas of my life and so, with my current progress towards eventually obtaining a MSCD certification, I hope to become fully fledged ASAP.
